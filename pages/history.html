  Google Chrome Experiments was launched in March 2009 with 19 experiments The main reason for its inception was to
  demonstrate and test the abilities of JavaScript and Google's V8 JavaScript engine. With time it also started featuring
  other open source web-based technologies such as HTML5, Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), WebGL, Web Audio, and Canvas
  element. The focus of the project throughout has been on open source technology and thus does not feature proprietary
  software such as Adobe Flash. The website is steadily gaining popularity along with the number of featured experiments.
  The number of experiments increased to 50 by August 2009, to 100 by July 2010, and to 500 by September 2012. As of
  August 2013 the number of experiments on the website were way over 600.

  The earliest projects featured on the site were mainly visualizations, interactive toys, and simple online games. The
  earliest contributors (according to Google's official blog) were made by artists and programmers like Casey Reas,
  Ricardo Cabello (Mr.doob), Ryan Alexander, Joshua T. Nimoy, and Karsten Schmidt (Toxi). Since its inception and launch,
  Chrome Experiments has featured only user submitted projects on their site, with a few exceptions of projects submitted
  by Google's teams. However these submissions are first curated by the Chrome Experiments team and then posted on the
  site for reviews and comments. It is also important to note that the user submitted projects are not hosted on the
  Google site; Chrome Experiments only posts a verified link to the developer's website.

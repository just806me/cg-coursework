<div class="section">
  Chrome Experiments was originally started to demonstrate the usability of JavaScript alone, but with time it has now
  become a platform to showcase capabilities of some other open-source web based technologies such as WebGl, HTML5, SVG,
  and Canvas element.

  <h4 class="heading">JavaScript</h4>

  JavaScript is a scripting language that is mainly used for creating for implementing dynamic website pages and enhanced
  user interfaces for web browsers. Highly influenced by programming languages such as C, Java, Self, and Scheme,
  JavaScript supports object oriented, functional, and imperative programming styles. Even though its name has Java in it,
  it is an entirely different language from Java. JavaScript is the main area of focus on Chrome Experiments, so nearly
  all of the experiments showcased on the site use JavaScript in some form or other.

<div class="section">
  <h4 class="heading">HTML5</h4>

  Hyper Text Markup language or HTML is the most used markup language for displaying web pages and the backbone language
  for internet itself. HTML5 is the 5th revision of HTML standards. It facilitates playing of audio and video elements
  in the browser itself, usage of Scalable Vector Graphics, and with the help of JavaScript or CSS3 programmers can even
  design animations.

  All Chrome experiments are browser based, thus all have some relation to HTML, and because of new Canvas element unique
  to HTML5, nearly all of the paint and design tools on the site along with some games, utilize HTML5 and Canvas 2-D element.

<div class="section">
  <h4 class="heading">Cascading Style Sheets</h4>

  Cascading style sheets (CSS) is style sheet language that is used to format the structure and look of a webpage written
  in markup languages such as HTML and XHTML. Along with markup languages it can also be used to format XML documents.
  CSS allows developers to move formatting attributes such as font color, font style, font size, background color,
  borders, section sizes, and other elements, to be moved in a single separate file resulting in much simpler code and
  much flexible handling of final rendering. Because of this feature, CSS is heavily used in nearly all Chrome experiments.

<div class="section">
  <h4 class="heading">WebGL</h4>

  WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is a JavaScript API used for rendering 3-D and 2-D graphics and animations in the web
  browsers itself without any additional plugin. The web browser should be compatible with the API. WebGL is an open source
  API that is based on Open Graphic Library Embedded systems (OpenGL ES) and draws inspiration from Canvas 3-D element.
  WebGL is currently supported by Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, along with limited support by Safari and Opera.
  Internet Explorer, however, has no inbuilt support for WebGL until now but a user can view WebGL section on IE using
  additional browser plugins.

  Utilized by 529 experiments out of 1127, WebGL is one of the most commonly used technologies on the site. The technology
  has also gained active use in famous and useful online apps such as Google Maps, and Zygote Body (formerly Google Body).

<div class="section">
  <h4 class="heading">HTML5 Audio</h4>

  Web audio or HTML5 audio, is the high level JavaScript API that is used for processing and playback of audio section on
  the browser itself, without any additional plugins. All experiments on the Google Chrome Experiment site are designed
  to be interactive and attractive, thus Web-audio is an integral part of most of these projects.

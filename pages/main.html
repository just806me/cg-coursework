  Google Chrome Experiments is an online showroom of web browser based experiments, interactive programs, and artistic
  projects. Launched in March 2009, Chrome Experiments is an official Google website that was originally meant to test
  the limits of JavaScript and the Google Chrome browser's performance and abilities. As the project progressed, it took
  the role of showcasing and experimenting latest open-source web-based technologies, such as JavaScript, HTML5, WebGL,
  Canvas, SVG, CSS, and some others. All the projects on Chrome experiments are user submitted and are made using open
  source technologies. As of February 24, 2015, there were 1000 different Chrome projects posted on the website.

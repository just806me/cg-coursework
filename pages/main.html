<div class="section">
  Google Chrome Experiments is an online showroom of web browser based experiments, interactive programs, and artistic
  projects. Launched in March 2009, Chrome Experiments is an official Google website that was originally meant to test
  the limits of JavaScript and the Google Chrome browser's performance and abilities.

  As the project progressed, it took the role of showcasing and experimenting latest open-source web-based technologies,
  such as JavaScript, HTML5, WebGL, Canvas, SVG, CSS, and some others. All the projects on Chrome experiments are made
  using open source technologies.

  Since its inception and launch, Chrome Experiments has featured only user submitted projects on their site, with a
  few exceptions of projects submitted by Google's teams. However these submissions are first curated by the Chrome
  Experiments team and then posted on the site for reviews and comments. It is also important to note that the projects are
  not hosted on the Google site; Chrome Experiments only posts a verified link to the developer's website.
